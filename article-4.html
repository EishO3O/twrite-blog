                    <h5>Members of the Chinese Coast Guard (CGG) were seen roving around the Rozul Reef in Palawan as they patrol the area on April 21, 2024</h5>
                    
                    <p>The South China Sea or West Philippine Sea (WPS) as the Philippines refers to its exclusive economic zone in these waters and highlighted in red below, has for a long time generated significant geopolitical tensions because of overlapping territorial claims with several Southeast Asian countries along with that country above it. The disagreements have triggered naval standoffs, caused diplomatic fallouts and even raised fears of an armed conflict between the two neighboring countries. These days a new development between the two states could pave way for an important diplomatic success. By the time of July 2,204, both countries de-escalated their tension and it seems territorial disputes met a new twist.</p>
                    <p>On the contrary, The West Philippine Sea is a resource-rich area, abundant in oil, gas, and fisheries, making it a vital economic zone for the countries that border it. The sea is also a crucial global shipping route, with one-third of the world's maritime trade passing through its waters.</p>

                    <span class="image main"><img src="images\article-4-2.png" alt="Map dictating china’s claims with its self-made 10-dash line demarcation & west philippine sea according to the 20216 Hague ruling." /></span>
                    <h5>Visual Map representation of the Chinese claimed 10 dash line and the west philippine sea coverage according to the Hague ruling in 2016.</h5>
                    
                    <p>China claims almost the entire South China Sea, a waterway through which about $3 trillion worth of sea-borne trade passes every year. It's based on China's 'nine-dash line,' which covers much of the sea. But in 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled against most of China's expansive claims to the sea and a decision that Beijing has ignored. Since then, tensions have remained high and military or coast guard stand-offs are not uncommon between ships from claimant states.</p>
                    <p>For some time, the situation in the West Philippine Sea has become even more volatile. Chinese maritime militias have been reported patrolling contested waters, blocking Filipino fishermen from their traditional fishing grounds, and building military installations on artificial islands. The Philippines, under various administrations, has struggled with finding a balance between asserting its territorial rights and maintaining a working relationship with China, a key economic partner.</p>

                    <p>Diplomatic protests and face-offs between Philippine and Chinese vessels eased up this year, but they once again reached their highest levels in 2 years in 2023. Nevertheless, July 2024 saw this tension between both countries well relaxed. More talks in different levels where the usually opaque diplomatic shorthand for top officials talking to one another directly or by way of relations in third countries. July 2024 saw this tension between both countries well relaxed.  which might include those near warred-over borders, as little distance from either side is covered scale, ink and no amount of diplomacy will alter that fact on a ground scale and there highlights mutual interests in calming down matters.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, the recent agreement between China and the Philippines to reduce tensions in the West Philippine Sea now represents a step forward in addressing a significant geopolitical challenge in the said area. Despite the challenges in this regard, this diplomatic progress offers a chance for stability, cooperation, and a peaceful resolution in one of the most contested maritime regions globally. The longevity of this deal remains uncertain. At present, this outcome brings a small hope amid the conflict in the region.</p>
