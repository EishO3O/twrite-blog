                    <p>I've always enjoyed playing games like League, WoW, and Assassin's Creed. Character growth, diverse environments, and difficult challenges make the experience so appealing. For me, it's a beautiful escape from the stresses of everyday life; it allows me to unwind and decompress in ways that nothing else does.</p>
                    <p>However, as we get older, the amount of time we can devote to these hobbies reduces, while the burden of obligations grows. Life started to feel dull, typical, and uninteresting. That's when I decided to start playing a new game: the game of life. I decided to challenge myself to set goals and overcome obstacles, just like in a video game. I wanted to see how far I could push myself and what kind of achievements I could unlock in my own reality.</p>
                    <h2>Game Plan for the First Two Months</h2>
                    <p>In the early months of this year, I decided to make a New Year's resolution—something I know I can commit to and stick to for a year, as well as try something new. Before I started, I had a few things to keep in mind when playing this game. According to philosopher Bernard Suits, playing a game involves:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <h3>"A voluntary attempt to overcome unneeded impediments."</h3>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>With this philosophy in mind, I laid out the rules and elements of my life game:
                        <li><b>Experience Points (XP):</b> Points earned based on the time spent and effort invested in an activity.</li>
                        <li><b>Loop Quests:</b> Daily, weekly, or monthly responsibilities or activities, such as schoolwork.</li>
                        <li><b>Side Quests:</b> Occasional assignments or tasks that arise from time to time.</li>
                        <li><b>Main Quests:</b> Major life goals that lead to personal success, such as acquiring my driver’s license or finding a job.</li>
                    </p>
                    <span class="image main"><img src="images\article-2-2.webp" alt="Image of Mastery Levels in Assassin's Creed: Odyssey | Ubisoft " /></span>
                    <h5>Skill Tree (Assassin's Creed: Odyssey) | Assassin's Creed Wiki | Fandom</h5>
                    
                    
                    <h2>Game Plan for the First Two Months</h2>
                    <p>Using this gamified method, I noticed major improvements in my lifestyle and routines over the course of three months. My daily thinking and actions changed significantly. For example, if I had a healthy breakfast, I would gain +2 in health. When commuting, I would gain +2 in perception, +3 in social contacts, and +4 in exercise. At school, I might earn +10 in knowledge, +2 in health for lunch, +3 in communication, +2 in knowledge for reviewing notes, and +8 for a good night's sleep. I would tally these points before going to bed and review my current stats before falling asleep.</p>
                    <p>The tasks become more enjoyable and satisfying. I became entirely absorbed in the task at hand, spending hours studying or working without recognizing the passing of time. I was in the zone, and the sense of accomplishment I felt after accomplishing difficult chores and meeting my goals was really fulfilling. I felt a delight I had never known before—I never believed that studying or working could be so satisfying.</p>
                    
                    <span class="image main"><img src="images\article-2-3.png" alt="Image of Mastery Levels in Assassin's Creed: Odyssey | Ubisoft " /></span>
                    <h5>Assassin's Creed® Valhalla: Mastery Challenge</h5>
                    
                    <h2>Challenges and reflections from the past few months</h2>
                    <p>In recent months, however, I've noticed that achieving a flow state has become more challenging. The gamified approach may not always be actively in use but instead encourages specific activities that can be measured. I realized this can lead to feelings of constant pressure and competitiveness with myself. This persistent pressure can be exhausting and can detract from the enjoyment of the "game" itself.</p>
                    <p>Recognizing this, I decided to take a break from the game and concentrate on other aspects of my life, such as being present and unconcerned about the metrics. I sought to achieve a healthier balance in my life so that I could return to the game feeling reinvigorated and ready to take on new challenges.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>All things considered, gamifying my life has greatly aided me in setting priorities and determining how to reach them. I became grateful for myself for the little things I considered to be unessential before and I started to value myself and the experiences that I get from the world. Despite the fact that my time doing this was limited, the experiment is far from over; whether you are a speedrunner, grinder, or casual gamer, it is essential to prioritize taking breaks and checking oneself to ensure you are still enjoying the experience.</p>
